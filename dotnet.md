*   [**PowerShell**](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx) - The full power of .NET, WMI and COM all from a command line. PowerShell has a steep learning curve, much like the tango, but oh, my, when you really start dancing...woof. I also use [PowerShell Prompt Here](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingPowerShellPromptHere.aspx). It's built into Windows 7, by the way.
    *   I also recommend after installing PowerShell that you immediately go get [**PowerTab**](http://powertab.codeplex.com/) to enable amazing "ANSI-art" style command-line tab completion.
	*   Next, go get the [**PowerShell Community Extensions**](http://www.codeplex.com/PowerShellCX) to add dozens of useful commands to PowerShell.
	*   Want a more advanced GUI for PowerShell? Get the free [**PowerGUI**](http://www.powergui.org/).
*   [**LINQPad**](http://www.linqpad.net/) - Interactively query your databases with LINQ with this tool from Joseph Albahari. A fantastic learning tool for those who are just getting into LINQ or for those who want a code snippet IDE to execute any C# or VB expression. Free and wonderful. There's a [whole list of LINQ related tools on Jim Wooley's site as well](http://www.thinqlinq.com/Post.aspx/Title/LINQ-Tools).
*   [**MarkdownPad 2**](http://markdownpad.com/) - For the longest time there were only attempts at a good Markdown editor on Windows. Now there's an awesome one and it puts others to shame. Get MarkdownPad 2, it's lovely.
*   [**scriptcs**](http://scriptcs.net/) - You can easily install scriptcs with Chocolatey, and you'll quickly be able to execute C# scripts with no need to compile. Just make a .csx file, no need for even a class if you like, and you're off. It's C# and PowerShell and something more. Definitely a project to watch in 2014.
*   [**Microsoft Web Platform Installer**](http://www.microsoft.com/web/) - When I need to take a machine from fresh install to developer machine quickly, I start at [http://www.microsoft.com/web/](http://www.microsoft.com/web/) and use the Platform Installer to get SQL Express, Visual Studio Express and several dozen other applications installed fast. It's also nice in that it'll setup PHP and ASP.NET open source applications easily. ;
*   [![webessentials](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Scott-Hanselmans-2014-Ultimate-Developer_A5EF/webessentials_3.png "webessentials")](http://vswebessentials.com)
*	[**Web Essentials for Visual Studio**](http://vswebessentials.com) - So essential, in fact, that Web Essentials is our official/unofficial "ASP.NET Web Tools Labs" where Mads Kristensen and friends put all their crazy ideas for future version of Visual Studio. The best features graduate into the released product! And it's open source!
*   [**GitHub for Windows**](http://windows.github.com/) - Truly one of the best WPF apps out there, and it's not just for GitHub, it's a great Git client in its own right. **Pro Tip:** Press ~ while you're browsing within a repo to get a PowerShell console with PoshGit preconfigured! Awesome.
    *   Also of note is [**SourceTree**](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), it supports not only Git but also Mercurial and is very clean. Talks to any remote Git or HG service.
*   [**JetBrains dotPeek .NET decompiler**](http://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/) - The original .NET [Reflector](http://www.reflector.net/) is no longer free, but JetBrains dotPeek is. Dig into the internals of any .NET assembly from .NET 1.0 to .NET 4 and beyond.
        *   Want a Reflector tool but want it to be Open Source? Check out [**ILSpy**](http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/ilspy.ashx) from the folks that brought you [SharpDevelop](http://www.icsharpcode.net/).
*   **TWO WAY TIE:** [**Notepad2**](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html) and [**Sublime Text**](http://www.sublimetext.com/). The world of text editing has conflated to these two contenders. I use notepad2 for my better notepad, but Sublime fills that space between a full IDE (although it's very close!) and a text editor. Get them both! And make sure you add [Sublime's Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/).
*   [**CodeRush**](https://www.devexpress.com/Products/CodeRush/) (and [DxCore](https://www.devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/DXCore/)) - Apparently my enthusiasm for CodeRush has been noticed by a few. It just keeps getting better. However, the best kept secret about CodeRush isn't all the shiny stuff, it's the free Extensibility Engine called DxCore that brings VS.NET plugins to the masses.
    *   CodeRush just added a cool new feature in 13.2 called [Unit Test Builder](https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/markmiller/archive/2013/12/04/new-in-coderush-13-2-unit-test-builder.aspx) that is truly amazing.
*   [**ReSharper**](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) - Whether you're working in large existing codebases or practicing TDD, ReSharper is one of the top Developer Productivity Tools on the market. Give it a try.
*   [**ZoomIt**](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897434.aspx) - You need to present? Make your stuff seen. ZoomIt is so elegant and so fast, it has taken over as my #1 screen magnifier. Do try it, and spend more time with happy audiences and less time dragging a magnified window around. Believe me, I've tried at least ten different magnifiers, and ZoomIt continues to be the best. Even though there's magnification built into Windows 7 via the "Window + Plus" key, I keep ZoomIt around so I can draw on the screen like [John Madden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Madden_(football)).
*   [**Fiddler**](http://www.fiddlertool.com/) - The easy, clean, and powerful debugging proxy for checking out HTTP between here and there. It even supports sniffing SSL traffic.
*   [**Mite2**](http://mite.keynote.com/) - A free desktop-based tool for testing and verification of mobile Web content. A must have for sites that need broad mobile coverage.
*   [**BrowserStack**](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/crossbrowserdebuggingintegratedintovisualstudiowithbrowserstack.aspx) - Browser Stack is an amazing cloud of virtual machines running dozens of browsers on as many operating system. A fantastic cross-browser testing tool that has optional Visual Studio integration.
*   [**WinMerge**](http://winmerge.org/) or [**BeyondCompare**](http://www.scootersoftware.com/) - I'm a BeyondCompare person and have purchased it, but WinMerge is getting better and better. It's free, it's open source and it'll compare files and folders and help you merge your conflicted source code files like a champ.
	*   [**Perforce Visual Merge**](http://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce_visual_merge_and_diff_tools) is free and also can diff images, which is pretty amazing.
*   [**Postman**](http://www.getpostman.com/) - Amazing HTTP and REST client that runs inside Google Chrome. It's TiVo for your Web Service.
    *   For a server-side collaborate solution for Web Services, check out [https://www.runscope.com](https://www.runscope.com)
*   [**NirSoft Utilities Collection**](http://www.nirsoft.net/) - Nearly everything NirSoft does is worth looking at. My favorites are[MyUninstaller](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/myuninst.html), a replacement for Remove Programs, and [WhoIsThisDomain](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/whois_this_domain.html).
    *   Also check out [ZipInstaller](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/zipinst.html); it _installs utilities that don't provide their own installer_! It creates icons, puts them in the folder you want and adds an uninstaller.
	*   You love to Ctrl-Scroll with your mouse to zoom the size of text, right? Why not use [**Volumouse**](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/volumouse.html) to control your system's sound volume with the mouse wheel. Magical.
*   [**BugShooting**](http://www.bugshooting.com/) - Funny how you don't know if you need an application until you need one. BugShooting is very specific - it takes screenshots, sure, but more importantly it sends them directly into your Bug Tracking system.
*   [**WinCheat**](http://alinconstantin.dtdns.net/Download/WinCheat/) - Not a tool to cheat Windows or in games, WinCheat is like Spy++ in that it lets you dig deep into the internals of the PE format and the Win32 Windowing subsystems. I'm consistently surprised how often I need an app like this.
*   [**Telerik Code Converter**](http://converter.telerik.com/) - Website that converts C# to VB and VB to C#.
*   [**Kaxaml**](http://www.kaxaml.com/) - The original and still the most awesome notepad for XAML, a must for WPF or Silverlight developers.
*   [**NuGet**](http://www.nuget.org/)- If you're using .NET you've gotta be using NuGet. It's Package Management for .NET and it's about time.
    *   [**NuGet Package Explorer**](http://npe.codeplex.com/) - This essential NuGet Explorer installs quickly as a Click Once application and lets you open NuGet Packages, search the NuGet website directly as well as author specs and publish NuGet packages directly from the GUI.
*   [**MSBuildShellExtension**](http://www.codeplex.com/msbuildshellex) - Really ought to be built in. Right-click on any .NET project and build it directly from Explorer.
*   [**FireBug**](http://www.getfirebug.com/) - It's a complete x-ray into your browser including HTML, CSS and JavaScript, all live on the page. A must have. It's on the list twice. Go get it.
    *   [**YSlow for FireBug**](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/) - This fine little add-on from Yahoo not only includes [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) (included on this list below) but more importantly analyzes your website for 13 different [rules for high performance web sites](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/index.html#rules). Not every rule applies to us, but it's a great tool regardless.
	*   [**YSlow for Chrome**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ninejjcohidippngpapiilnmkgllmakh) - The same YSlow you love, now for Chrome.
	*   Extend Firebug with [**Firepicker**](http://thedarkone.github.com/firepicker/) for easier color management for your CSS and Styles.
*   [**WebDeveloper**](http://chrispederick.com/work/firefox/webdeveloper/) **for**[**FireFox**](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) - If you're the last developer to download FireFox, or you're holding off, WebDeveloper is a solid reason to switch to FireFox NOW. It's amazing and has to be used to be believed. It consolidates at least 2 dozens useful functions for those who sling ASP.NET or HTML. And if you're a CSS person, the realtime CSS editing is pretty hot.
*   [**CodePaste.NET**](http://codepaste.net/) - When you write code, you need to share it.
    *   Also try [**Pastie**](http://www.pastie.org/) and [**Gist**](http://gist.github.com/) for sharing snippets.
*   [**Jabbr**](http://jabbr.net)- A fresh alternative to IRC.*   [**NCrunch**](http://www.ncrunch.net/) - Automated unit testing for .NET. Runs them in parallel and automatically, inserting the results inline inside Visual Studio. Familiar with Continuous Integration? Meet Continuous Testing.
*   **[Pixie](http://www.nattyware.com/pixie.php)** - Simple, cute and portable. It's a color picker.
*   [**Siren of Shame**](http://www.sirenofshame.com/) - If you've got a continuous integration server setup, you really need a way to guilt people that break the build. You need a Siren of Shame.
*   [**NDepend**](http://www.ndepend.com/) - This amazing app does dependency analysis on your .NET application and presents the findings as a TreeMap.
*   [**NCover**](http://www.ncover.com/) - The leader in .NET code coverage tools. Deep and broad. Free for students and educational users.
*   [**Query Express**](http://www.albahari.com/queryexpress.html) - Wow, a Query Analyzer look-alike that doesn't suck, doesn't need an install, is wicked fast, is free and is only 100k. Pinch me, I'm dreaming. It's 6 years old and I still like it.&nbsp;
*   [**PostSharp**](http://www.postsharp.net/download) - Take your code beyond code generation and stay DRY with aspect oriented programming. Inject repetitive code directly into your application with frameworks that cross cut concerns.
*   [**Help+Manual**](http://www.helpandmanual.com/) - There's few good options for creating Help Files on Windows but while Help+Manual does cost money, it's a pretty amazing and complete system.
    *   [**HelpNDoc**](http://www.helpndoc.com/) - Not sure how I missed this one. _Free _for personal use and greats PDFs, CHMs, and more.
*   [**TreeTrim**](http://code.google.com/p/treetrim/) or [**Jeff Atwood's CleanSourcesPlus**](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000368.html) - Jeff extends on [Omar](http://www.shahine.com/omar)'s idea of a quick Explorer utility that lets you right click on any folder with code in it and get your bin,obj,debug,release directories blown away. Jeff's includes configuration options for deleting things like Resharper folders and Source Control bindings. TreeTrim is a similar command-line tool for cleaning up, but on steroids, including a plugin model.
*   [**Visual Studio Gallery**](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/) - All the world's extensions to Visual Studio in one place, and ranked by the public. Easy to search and sort.
*   [**SQL Complete**](http://www.devart.com/dbforge/sql/sqlcomplete/) - Adds Intellisense to SQL Server Management Studio and it's free. How can you not like that?
*   [**FileHelpers**](http://www.filehelpers.com/) - This open source library is the easiest way I've found to get data out of fixed-length or delimited text files and into Sql or Excel.
*   [**MemProfiler**](http://memprofiler.com/) - The amount of information this tool offers is obscene. We used this at my last job to track down a number of funky memory leaks
*   [**HeidiSQL**](http://www.heidisql.com/) - Complete tiny MySQL and SqlServer management app. Supported by apps.
*   [**LogParser**](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=890cd06b-abf8-4c25-91b2-f8d975cf8c07&amp;displaylang=en) - Get to know it, as it's a free command-line tool from Microsoft that lets you run SQL queries against a variety of log files and other system data sources, and get the results out to an array of destinations, from SQL tables to CSV files. I [dig it and use it to parse my own logs](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ParsingMyIISLogFilesWithLogParser22ToLearnMoreAboutBlogsStatsFromNewsGatorAndNewsGatorOnline.aspx)
    *   LogParser is good, we know, but [**LogParserLizard**](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AnalyzeYourWebServerDataAndBeEmpoweredWithLogParserAndLogParserLizardGUI.aspx) is great. LogParserLizard is a [GUI for LogParser and a free download](http://www.lizard-labs.net/log_parser_lizard.aspx).
