*   [**Codeclimate**](https://codeclimate.com) - Online code analysis and quality metrics
*   [**ExplainShell.com**](http://explainshell.com/) - Genius. Explains how a unix chained-together command works and what does what.
*   [**JSFiddle**](http://jsfiddle.net/) - Sometimes you just want to fiddle with JavaScript. Fire up a text editor, IDE or Firebug? Naw, man. Use JSFiddle, load your framework of choice and get to work. HTML, CSS and JavaScript plus your results. Then share with a friend!
*   [**CSSDeck**](http://cssdeck.com/) - Three boxes and online! HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all combined into one of the most creative places on the internet. You'll learn more about CSS here than in any book.&nbsp;

*   [**Bit.ly**](http://bit.ly/) - All the goodness of TinyUrl with statistics, real-time tracking, accounts and much, much more. If you get a Bit.ly url, add a + to the end of it to see lots of statistics!
*   [**Markup.io**](http://markup.io/) - So smart. Got a webpage to markup? Don't download an app. Use this bookmarklet, mark it up directly in the browser, then share a marked up URL. Magic. [Like this](http://markup.io/v/tjy07ajt25pe).
*   [**BrowserShots**](http://browsershots.org/) - What's your site look like in MSIE4.0? Opera 9.64? This site will show you.
*   [**Visibone HTML/JavaScript Reference**](http://www.visibone.com/) - These guys make a great physical paper reference, but they also have a great .HTML file you can download for free that has ASCII charts and Color references.&nbsp; It's a link I keep close by.
*   [**StackOverflow**](http://stackoverflow.com/) - Get your questions answered here! If you haven't heard, you better ask someone.
*   [**SQL Designer**](http://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/) - A web-based DHTML/AJAX SQL Entity Relationship Designer that exports .SQL files. Seriously. Drink that in, then visit it.
*   **BrowserStack.com** - VNC remote into any OS with any browser, even super obscure ones, and test your web app.
*   [**ViewPure**](http://viewpure.com/) - Watch a YouTube video. Just the video and not the rest of the crap or ads or other videos around it. It's readability for YouTube.

*   [**Del.icio.us**](http://del.icio.us/shanselman) - A social distributed bookmarks manager. It took me a bit to get into it, but their[Bookmarklets](http://del.icio.us/doc/about) that you drag into your Links toolbar won me over. All my bookmarks are here now and I can always find what I need, wherever I am. Very RESTful. I have used this for YEARS.
	*	Be sure to get their [Del.icio.us IE Buttons](http://delicious.com/help/tools) and [shiny extensions](http://delicious.com/help/tools).
*   [**Kuler**](http://kuler.adobe.com/) - A wonderful color scheme chooser for when you aren't a designer but you wish you were.
*   [**Color Scheme Designer**](http://colorschemedesigner.com/) - I'm not a designer and I have no style, but I do know what I like. This site makes it easy to brainstorm, design and tweak a color scheme for your next big project.
*   [**smtp4dev**](http://smtp4dev.codeplex.com/) - I often write apps that fire out emails and notifications. It's great to fire up a little SMTP mail server and have the emails delivered to a local folder. Great for testing and debugging anything that sends mail.
*   [**HTML5 Boilerplate**](http://html5boilerplate.com/)- A good place to start when you're learning about HTML5 and are ready to create sites that look great and work great everywhere.
*   [**TypeTester**](http://www.typetester.org/) - The very best way to compare up to three different web-typefaces.

*   [**32 Bookmarklets for Web Designers**](http://speckyboy.com/2009/02/16/32-indispensable-bookmarklets-for-web-developers-and-designers/) - I use these when I'm DEEP into some thing CSSy and it's tearing me apart.
*   [**http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/**](http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/) - Is that Website Down For Everyone Or Just Me? Enough said.
*   [**QuirksMode**](http://www.quirksmode.org/) - Over 150 pages of details on CSS and JavaScript. When my brain is overflowing with the HTML of it all, I head here.
*   [**BuiltWith**](http://builtwith.com/) - What was that site BUILT WITH?
*   [**Google Maps**](http://maps.google.com/) + [**HousingMaps.com**](http://www.housingmaps.com/) - Google Maps is cool, but [Paul Rademacher's](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~rademach/) [HousingMaps.com](http://www.housingmaps.com/) is synergy. It was the **first** great Mashup of Web 2.0 and I keep it around to remind me of what's possible if you keep an idea fresh and simple.
*   [**ProxySwitcher**](http://mwiedemeyer.de/ProxySwitcher) - Always on the road and switching between client networks? Now switch your proxy servers as fast as you change pants.

*   [**PortableApps.com**](http://portableapps.com/) - Take all your favorite apps with you on a USB key without installing them! All your settings remain. Be sure to get [PStart](http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/pstart), the handy Portable Apps Launcher for the Tray.
    *	More Portable apps at [http://portablefreeware.com/](http://portablefreeware.com/)
*   [**JSLint**](http://www.jslint.com/) - Just what is sounds like, it's a JavaScript "Lint" tool that will tidy up your JavaScript and also tell you why your code sucks.
    *   There's also [**JSHint**](http://www.jshint.com/) which is a prettier than JSLint.
