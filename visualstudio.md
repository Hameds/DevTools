*   [**Productivity Power Tools**](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/dbcb8670-889e-4a54-a226-a48a15e4cace) - Two dozen cool new enhancements to Visual Studio. The best features get into the next version of VS. Check out PeekHelp, TimeStampMargin, RecentlyClosedTabs, and LOTS more.
*   [**Electric Plum iPhone Mobile Simulator**](http://www.electricplum.com/simulator.aspx) - A nice little iOS browsing experience emulator. Saves me time when writing jQuery Mobile sites.
	*   I also use the [**Opera Mobile Emulator**](http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/mobile/) to see how my sites will turn out on small or tablet devices.
*   [**Web Essentials**](http://www.vswebessentials.com) - Add [Browser Link features](http://www.asp.net/visual-studio/overview/2013/visual-studio-2013-web-editor-features-browser-link), improved CSS editing, color preview, font preview and lots more to Visual Studio with this lightweight and actively developed "playground" extension. Yes, I mentioned it twice.
*   [**CodeMaid**](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/76293c4d-8c16-4f4a-aee6-21f83a571496) - Deep and powerful open source code cleanup tool that supports not just C# and VB, but also F#, XAML, CSS and much more!
*   [**OzCode**](http://www.oz-code.com/) - Formerly BugAid, OzCode takes the concept of a Debug Visualizer to the next level. Visualize forloops and their future, compare expressions, dig deep and compare arrays and much more. Free while in Beta.
*   [**NuGet Package Manager**](http://www.nuget.org) - NuGet integrates into the References node of the Solution Explorer, enables Package Management and brings PowerShell directy into to Visual Studio.
*   [**VsVim**](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329) - Obsessed with the Vim editor but also like Visual Studio? Why not like them both? It's also open source.
*   [**StyleCop**](http://stylecop.codeplex.com/) - StyleCop analyzes C# source code to enforce a set of style and consistency rules. It can be run from inside of Visual Studio or integrated into an MSBuild project. Totally useful by yourself or with a team.
	*   Use [**StyleCop.MSBuild**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StyleCop.MSBuild/) to integrate StyleCop into your system's build with NuGet!
*   [**Code Digger**](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/fb5badda-4ea3-4314-a723-a1975cbdabb4) (based on [**Pex**](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/pex/)) - Amazing Visual Studio addin that finds edge cases in your code that ordinary unit testing never can.
*   [**WiX Toolset**](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/b6868002-9770-4479-80a7-259de34df527) - Creating setup projects got harder with VS2013 as deployment projects were removed. Consider the Free and Open Source WiX Toolset, recently updated to support 2013! Extremely mature and trusted.
*   [**Atomineer**](http://www.atomineerutils.com/) - The last word in code documentation generation, this tool lets you take unruly code comments across 7 languages and lets you turn it into Qt, JavaDoc, Doxygen, and Documentation XML.
